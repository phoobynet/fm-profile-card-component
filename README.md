## My process

### Built with

- Vite
- React
- React Router DOM
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- ESLint/StyleLint
- Prettier
- JS Standard-ish (you don't need semicolons sheeple!)
- src path is aliased as @.
- Husky and lint-staged are installed

### What I learned

I learnt that you don't always need grid, sometimes flex is appropriate.

I didn't understand how to place multiple background images.  This took me longer than a care to admit. 

### Continued development

Get some layout patterns under my belt, and practice them.
